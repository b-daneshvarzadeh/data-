 the second, third  andfurth rows are equal.now suppose that this is true for n =k.so the second, third and fourth rows in(M^K)r
 are equal.now proof this for n =k +1.

                        |z_1|   |1/2 z_1 +z_2    |
    (M^k+1) =M(M^K)r = M|z_2|  =|1/3 z_1 +1/2 z_2|
                        |z_2|   |1/3 z_1 +1/2 z_2|       so this is true .
                        |z_2|   |1/3 z_1 +1/2 z_2|

 5.1.6
 supose we have K vertexes. kth vertex is dead-end,so we delete it. now k-1th vertex is dead-end,and so delete itand continue this
 s way
 so that find the first vertex. page ranke of this vertex is equal 1. now we connect the second vertex to the graph.
 page ranke of this vertex is 1/2. becouse the first vertex linke to it the number of out-link is 2.
 now we consider the third  vertes. the page ranke of this vertex is page ranke v_2 *1/out-link of v_2 =1/2 * 1 =1/2.
 so page ranke of Kth vertex is equal to 1/2 *1/ (out-links of v_k-2) =1/2.
 =============================================================================================================================
 5.1.7
 we delete vertexes which are dead-ens in n-th level.so all of the vertex in this level deleted.now consider the vertexes of 
 (n-1th) level. these are dead-end too.and we continue to level 2  in this level we have two dead-end vertex.
 delete these.page rank of this vertex is equal to 1. now we add the vertexes of level 2. the page ranke of each of
 these vertex is equal to:
                           page ranke of v_0 *1/(out-link of v_0) =1* 1/3 =1/3
                           
then we add the vertex of 3th level.in this level added 4 vertexes v_3 , v_4 , v_5 , v_6.
page ranke of v_i, 3<i > 6, is :

                                page ranke v_1 *1/(out-link v_3) =1/3 *1/2 =1/6
                                
in the K-th level the number of added vertexes is :
                                                    2^k =2*(the number of vertexes in (k-1)-th)
                                                    
in the end level the page rank of each vertex is:
                                                 page rtank of vertex in (k-1-th)level *1/number of out-link
                                                 =page ranke of vertex in (k-1th)level *1/2
   because the page ranke of vertexes in k-1th level is equal and the out-links is equal too.
